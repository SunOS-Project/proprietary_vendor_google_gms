    <!-- Set this to true to enable the platform's auto-power-save modes like doze and
         app standby.  These are not enabled by default because they require a standard
         cloud-to-device messaging service for apps to interact correctly with the modes
         (such as to be able to deliver an instant message to the device even when it is
         dozing).  This should be enabled if you have such services and expect apps to
         correctly use them when installed on your device.  Otherwise, keep this disabled

    <!-- Whether to only install system packages on a user if they're allowlisted for that user
         type. These are flags and can be freely combined.
         0  - disable allowlist (install all system packages; no logging)
         1  - enforce (only install system packages if they are allowlisted)
         2  - log (log non-allowlisted packages)
         4  - any package not mentioned in the allowlist file is implicitly allowlisted on all users
         8  - same as 4, but just for the SYSTEM user
         16 - ignore OTAs (don't install system packages during OTAs)
         Common scenarios:
          - to enable feature (fully enforced) for a complete allowlist: 1
          - to enable feature for an incomplete allowlist (so use implicit allowlist mode): 5
          - to enable feature but implicitly allowlist for SYSTEM user to ease local development: 9
          - to disable feature completely if it had never been enabled: 16
          - to henceforth disable feature and try to undo its previous effects: 0
